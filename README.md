# Weighted Grade Calculator (Web)

Two ways to view the calculator:

- **Quick open:** double-click `index.html` (or open it in your browser) to use the in-browser calculator.
- **Local server (avoids any browser file restrictions):**
  1. From the project folder run `python -m http.server 8000`
  2. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Enter grades as `18/20` or `87.5`. Leave a field empty or type `none` to mark it as missing; use the optional goal field to see what average you need on remaining weight.
